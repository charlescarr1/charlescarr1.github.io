<p>The desire to own the biggest, baddest, shiniest forklift fresh off the assembly line is understandable. An overloaded pallet jack is likely to break down and can pose a serious safety hazard for its operators. The Rough Terrain Pallet Truck comes with Extended Raised Height compared to standard pallet trucks. With the largest window of any stockpicker, the Crown SP Series makes operators clearly more productive. We are offering Godrej 2.5 Ton Hand Pallet Truck to our clients.</p>
<p>3300-4500 mm Duplex or Triplex clear-view mast options available, to give you flexibility in customising your forklift for the job at hand. Crazy lift kits and cab stretching isn't just for light duty trucks. For example, a sit-down, counterbalanced high lift rider truck is more likely than a motorized hand truck to be involved in a falling load accident, because the sit-down rider truck can lift a load much higher than a hand truck.</p>

If you drive a forklift on an incline, you must keep the load on the uphill side. Flexibility is perhaps the greatest benefit to renting a forklift versus buying. We have new and used forklifts for sale and as rentals.</p>
<p>If it is only to be used for a handful of hours each week, you can safely settle for a used forklift that is ten to twelve years old, because you are likely to get another seven or eight years of useful service out of it. Buyers can make the mistake of only opting for more recent models of used fork trucks, but far more important than this is the number of operating hours and the overall condition of the second hand truck for sale.</p>
<p>8 Finished forklifts are shipped to the customer or distributor by truck or by rail. Customization and accessories for trucks go beyond what the manufacturer offers on brand new models, however, giving truck drivers even more freedom to make their pickups their own. Forklift rentals require research and planning, and that's where the experienced team at Thompson Lift Truck can help.</p>
