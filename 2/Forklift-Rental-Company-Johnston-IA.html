PA Industrial Equipment has an extensive selection of high quality, dependable, economical used forklifts. Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying the rated capacity load at maximum elevation shall not overturn when the platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to a slope of 4 percent about an axis parallel to the axis of the load wheels, and in a direction to increase the load overhang.</p>
<p>With Crown's Stability Stance, operators have four points of solid contact with the lift truck when stopping and starting from 9 metres in the air. Like a rental car, if you were to need insurance coverage, then this could be another $50 to $150+ per day and would only cover the truck. This is because the forks are mounted to the side of the truck and can pick up wide or long loads that would be awkward or inaccessible with a straight forward forklift.</p>
