<p>That's why our focus is making the forklift rental process quick and easy, without the usual red tape and fine print of the big rental companies. The 37-inch-wide C-G chassis—about five to six inches narrower than the chassis of a typical 4,000 to 7,000 lb. forklift—allows C-G Series forklifts to navigate tight rack storage aisles. Our stores in Sacramento, CA and throughout northern central California are fully equipped to meet your demands for rental forklifts.</p>

<p>If you rent forklift then it will work as a power based truck to lift and move industrial and raw materials. Experience proves that operators who are properly trained, keep within the forklift's load capacity, and follow rules of safe operation to avoid tipovers and accidents.
