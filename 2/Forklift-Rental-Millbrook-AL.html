<p>Steering, braking, accelerating and all the nuances of driving will change once the shape of the truck has changed, so be prepared for an all-new ride after completing a suspension lift.

<p>Protects sensitive lift truck control systems with hydraulic, mechanical and electrical components that are matched to different temperature levels. When you hear the name Nissan, you may think of cars and trucks, but the Japanese company is even more dominant in the lift industry. Safety standards implemented thoroughly can help keep workplace accidents at a minimum.</p>
<p>Five new forklift models - with load capacities from 1.4 - 2.5 tons - deliver class-leading performance, and lift heights up to 13 metres. Counterbalance forklift trucks are majorly preferred for use in applications where space is limited due to their effective maneuverability. A body lift increases the truck's ride height without changing the suspension, making them a good choice for light off-roading and adding a touch of style.</p>
