<p>JCB rough terrain forklifts are a reliable, comfortable, versatile and easy-to-use solution for any challenging rehandling environment. Stability - An order picker forklift must retain its stability even when picking goods at high elevations. Heavy duty design: 4mm steel plate fork frame and largerd lift piston ensure the truck to reach rated capacity.
