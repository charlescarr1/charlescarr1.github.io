The counterbalance forklift is a popular lift that features forks in the front and a weight in the back of the vehicle to counterbalance the weight of the load. Popular brands of standup forklifts include Yale, Crown, Baker, Hyster, and Raymond, which range in price from as little as $5,000 used to as much as $35,000 for a fully equipped new machine. Counterbalanced forklifts carry their loads in front of their support point.</p>
<p>The PTH Series pallet jack is designed for smooth, and quiet operation and easy handling so operators experience less fatigue and work more efficiently. Commonly lifted vehicles include most pickups and large SUVs, especially the Ford Excursion Any vehicle designed for off-road use, however, can be lifted. Counterbalance forklifts are just one of several types of forklifts found in today's workplaces.</p>

STILL offers rental trucks for flexible rental periods. Allowing operators to tow palletised or non-palletised loads, our towing tractors are suitable for indoor and outdoor applications, including production lines, cross-dock logistics, airports, railway stations and ports.</p>

<p>Buy Forklifts in bulk from us for the best quality products and service. A lifted suspension, though it's protected from scraping over rocks and debris, responds differently to this stress; if you lift your Jeep's suspension, your standard shocks might not do the trick. Its optimized design and 68.5” truck length - the shortest in the industry - ensures it can maneuver where no other 3-wheel counterbalance forklift can.</p>
<p>When it is necessary to omit the overhead guard, special attention should be given by the user and operator to conditions such as height and stability of loads and stacks, weight of individual units, and operating space including overhead obstructions. Whether you use rough terrain forklifts every day or once in awhile, these machines can handle major wear and tear.</p>
<p>However, that doesn't mean that everyone should jump feet first into the decision to install a lift kit on their truck. All rough terrain forklifts have heavy-duty tires that allow them to tackle outdoor conditions. May have more ground clearance than a cushion tire forklift. Powered industrial trucks are addressed in specific OSHA standards for General Industry, Marine Terminals, Longshoring and Construction.</p>
