One of the most popular adjustments to trucks is the lift kit - moving the entire truck higher in the air by changing out suspension parts.

<p>In addition, alternate rated capacities may be established at other load centers and other platform heights. It happens because the one side of the chain is fixed to the immovable frame of the forklift, and the only way by which masts can move upward is when gears rotate in clockwise direction and pull the forks overhead. Raising your truck can help making towing easier, as the increased ground clearance makes loading and unloading more accessible.</p>
<p>Fork lifts are essential equipment for industrial warehouses and large-scale shipping and receiving operations. All forklifts are rated for loads at a specified maximum weight capacity. A rough terrain forklift handles differently than a warehouse forklift, but most warehouse forklifts drive the same.
