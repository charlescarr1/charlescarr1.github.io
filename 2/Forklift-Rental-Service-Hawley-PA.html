Also called a pump truck, a pallet jack is smaller in size than the above mentioned forklifts.</p>

Like most other lifts, a counterbalance forklift has a pair of forks in front of the vehicle.

However, in both cases, these vehicles have to be operated by a person who can either sit or stand while operating the forklift.</p>
