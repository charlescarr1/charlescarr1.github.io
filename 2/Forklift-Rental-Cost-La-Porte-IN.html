<p>A truck that has had its suspension modified so that it rides way too far off the ground, usually to the point where the high center of gravity could actually be dangerous. The Pivot Steer Forklift Truck is commonly used in industry both inside of a warehouse and is ideal for very narrow aisle work as the mast can be rotated 90° to either side of the truck. It keeps some of the ride characteristics you love from the factory Jeep Wrangler spring while improving the off-road performance. We have an expansive inventory of pre-owned forklifts from Hyster, Taylor, Yale, Toyota, Caterpillar, Hoist, Kalmar, TCM and other leading brands.</p>

These permit the truck to drive over bumpy terrain without harming the vehicle's under-body. This abrasion can reduce the thickness of a fork until it cannot lift loads up to the designed capacity. Apart from this, a feedback of the spec sheet for Jungheinrich's 5000 lb. Electric counterbalanced truck shows that it has actually eclipsed the performance specifications of most internal combustion trucks.</p>
