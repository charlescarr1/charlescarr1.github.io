If you've bought it from a store, it was probably lifted from its place on the shelf by a worker many feet in the air with an order picker forklift.</p>
<p>Also, note that loads longer than 48” will extend your load center beyond the standard rating of a 24” load center. This is among a very good quality pallet truck with great durability and support. Call to discuss load types and warehouse limitations for your safety and accuracy. The rough-terrain or straight-mast forklift has become more of a niche machine, rather than an ‘everybody-needs-one' machine,” says Charlie Detrich, U.S. sales & dealer development manager for Liftking.</p>
