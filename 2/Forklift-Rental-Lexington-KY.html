<p>Looking to rent material handling equipment in Phoenix? These forklifts are known for what their name indicates, their ability to lift loads at a high altitude. OSHA General Industry Standard 1910.178()(1) Only stable or safely arranged loads shall be handled. Access Hire Australia have a range of rough terrain forklifts for hire to suit your needs including various operating weights, lift capacities and dimensions.

It may be tempting to buy one of the lifted trucks for sale in Phoenix without test driving it. But don't do it. Lifted cars can cost hundreds to thousands of dollars more So, if you are going to buy one, it's only fair that you test it out first.</p>
<p>Using the procedure outlined for these tests, a truck shall not overturn when the platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to a 14 per cent slope for loaded truck (Test #N5), and a 14 percent or 18 percent slope for unloaded truck (Test #N5A), depending on whether the truck has single rear-wheel drive (or brake) or dual rear-wheel drive (or brakes), respectively.</p>
<p>8 Finished forklifts are shipped to the customer or distributor by truck or by rail. Customization and accessories for trucks go beyond what the manufacturer offers on brand new models, however, giving truck drivers even more freedom to make their pickups their own. Forklift rentals require research and planning, and that's where the experienced team at Thompson Lift Truck can help.</p>
