<p>Lift Code 4: Three Wheel Electric Trucks, Sit Down. It was fun driving different types of sit down forklifts. On new forklifts we offer up to 72 months of either a $1 buyout or a True FMV lease option.

Different types of tyres are available for forklifts.

We have LPG, electric, diesel, and gasoline powered forklifts with lift capacity from 3,000 to 36,000 lb. We also rent manual pallet jacks, electric carts, scissor lifts, ramps, and various forklift attachments such as rotators, clamps, carpet poles, and extensions.</p>
