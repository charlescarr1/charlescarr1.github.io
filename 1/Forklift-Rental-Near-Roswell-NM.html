<p>Rough terrain forklifts, also known as all-terrain forklifts, are designed to work in construction sites and other areas without improved surfaces (soft ground, muddy ground, hills, ditches, etc.). The most significant difference between a standard industrial forklift (such as a Toyota) and a rough terrain forklift are the tires and ground clearance.</p>
<p>Standards Notice: SN 66 allows the use of a spring-loaded brake system or dock lock in lieu of chocking, as a means that secures trucks or trailers to loading docks.
