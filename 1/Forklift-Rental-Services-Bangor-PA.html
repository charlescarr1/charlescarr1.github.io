<p>Operate powered industrial trucks to load and unload materials and deliveries and move them to and from storage areas, machines and loading docks, into railroad cars or trucks or storage facilities. The two forks on the front of the truck slide underneath palletised loads, to lift and transport safely. Because rough terrain vertical mast forklifts are larger and made to handle heavier loads than vertical mast counterbalanced forklifts (classes 1, 4 and 5), they require more space to operate as well as a sturdy surface that offers substantial support.

Dayton® pallet trucks feature a cushion grip with a 3-position lever and a flow valve for controlled lowering.</p>
<p>Considered the most common type of forklift truck overall, counterbalanced models are designed with a weight that's built into the rear of the truck's body. Ausa T204H: This fork truck rental falls under the telehandler category, as it combines the lifting capacity of a forklift with the reach of a crane.
