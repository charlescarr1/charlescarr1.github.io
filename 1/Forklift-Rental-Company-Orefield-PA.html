<p>Gray Manufacturing has produced the highest quality jacks and lifting products for over 60 years. We provide UniCarriers Forklifts including stand up and sit down trucks from 3,000 to 15,500 lb. They have the ability to reach loads that sit up high and can extend to distances beyond their stabilising legs. Compared to a forklift, these machines have a smaller capacity. Drivers should know the capacity of the machine to prevent tipping due to overly heavy or improperly balanced loads.</p>
<p>This Raymond-exclusive feature maximizes truck speed as the platform rises, capitalizing on an area of opportunity for providing faster travel between picks compared to conventional speed control. Ground clearance same as cushion tire forklift or Electric 4 wheel units. With the test load supported by the forks in a normal and unrestrained manner, elevate the load to the maximum height at which unrestrained, horizontal travel is permitted.</p>

<p>Before settling on what forklift to purchase or rent, be certain you've got a good idea of the weights and dimensions of the loads you intend to lift. Its optimized design and quiet, stable mast allows for precise control of loads of all shapes and sizes, especially when used with a variety of attachments.

<h2>Reach Lift Truck Orefield</h2>
<p>The size of these machines allows them to lift greater capacities than the smaller forklifts featured in this list. Heubel Shaw's large rental fleet includes Reach trucks, Stand up forklifts, sitdown 4-wheel and 3-wheel forklifts, order pickers and pallet jacks. Rather than installing between the body and frame, these kits are used to physically increase the height of the suspension for the pickup, which raises the body and frame.</p>
<p>You can set them up with work-saver forks (roughly about 9” wide), and they lift pallets some few inches from the ground. Never try to stop a pallet jack with hands or feet, this could cause serious injury, especially with a very heavy load. There are some specialty trucks that are used in specific industries or in certain settings, such as a sideloader that picks up and carries pallets to the side of the vehicle instead of in the front.</p>
