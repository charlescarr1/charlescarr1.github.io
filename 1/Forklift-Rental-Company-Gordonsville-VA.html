Thanks to their high capacity of up to three tons and excellent manoeuvrability in even the tightest of spaces, hand pallet trucks represent ideal warehouse aids. They may be a bit worn out, so when the lift is installed, the proposed 2 inch leaves may only have lifted the truck 1.5 inches.</p>

<p>A warehouse, distribution center, or other workplace with narrow aisles is the ideal setting for a reach truck, also known as a reach forklift or narrow aisle forklift. Our clients can avail from us a qualitative range of Hydraulic Pallet Truck. Lifted cars can be dangerous, especially if you're driving behind them.
