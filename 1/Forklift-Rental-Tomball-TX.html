Generally, a lifted truck has the main frame and chassis raised up one or more feet above where it would normally sit on top of the tires.

Pallet trucks are the efficient and simple mode of transporting palletized loads on the shop floor. Suspension lifts can enable steeper approach, departure, and breakover angles, higher ground clearance, and helps accommodate larger wheels and tires.</p>
