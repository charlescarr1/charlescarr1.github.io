<p>If it is only to be used for a handful of hours each week, you can safely settle for a used forklift that is ten to twelve years old, because you are likely to get another seven or eight years of useful service out of it.

Reach trucks are used most in warehouses for placing and retrieving pallets in warehouse rack at elevated heights.

Lets face it, rust matters and when we start to build a truck to make it custom and lifted for our customer, we start with a rust free truck.</p>
<p>You may also ask to view the forklift's service record or work orders. Figure out whether you want to stick close to Ohio or are up for a road trip, and then consider one of these great vacation spots to visit in your lifted Jeep. The other, more complex style of truck lift is a suspension lift kit.” The suspension lift requires more work to accommodate and usually costs a bit more.</p>
