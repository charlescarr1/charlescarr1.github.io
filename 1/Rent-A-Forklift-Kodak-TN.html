For trucks with tilting masts, the mast should be vertical or at full rearward till, whichever is less stable.</p>

Every rental truck is prepped by a Raymond certified technician and quality inspected by our shop foreman to make sure that each piece of equipment is ready to work when it reaches your facility.
