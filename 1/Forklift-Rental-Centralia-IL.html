<p>Leveling kits do just that-level the stance of a Jeep or truck from front to rear. Achieving nearly 10% growth, Hangcha Group sold 82,350 units across all forklift classes, an increase of more than 23%, and good enough to climb from No. 12 in 2015 to No. 9.

<p>These rough terrain forklifts come with a higher ground clearance that is crucial to work on cross-country terrain.
