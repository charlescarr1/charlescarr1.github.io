<h2>Forklift Trucks From Concord </h2>
<p>We offer our customers access to both Factory New as well as Pre-Owned forklift trucks. At Granite Industrial Trucks we are ready to meet the needs of your company today.

We proudly offer Unicarrier, Hyundai, Baoli, Flexi, JLG, and Linde forklifts to meet your preference.</p>
<p>Before you decide to lift your truck, it's important to understand some of the pros and cons of driving a lifted vehicle. If your forklift is overloaded, it can cause it to tip to the side when you turn or when you are near a steep edge. Forklifts run on diesel, liquid propane and electric. If you have previously owned a forklift, determine what aspects you liked and didn't like about the lift.</p>
<p>On certain types of trucks, the weight on the braking wheel (s) may be insufficient to attain drawbar drag values required for higher combinations of ramp and speed. But "rough terrain" isn't simply an indication of the machine's robust nature. Turret trucks or Swing-Reach® can work in aisles as narrow as 60”, and are used for placing and retrieving pallets in warehouse rack at elevated heights.</p>

Standard counterbalance forklifts require aisles of approximately 13 ft wide to effectively turn, navigate, and move pallets.</p>

Designed to work specifically indoors in tight access environments like high density warehousing, standup forklifts offer a number of efficiency enhancing features that are not available on the "general use" standard sit-down forklift.</p>
