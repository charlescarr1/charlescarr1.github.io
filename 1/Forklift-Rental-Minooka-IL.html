The other makes use of a see-through overhead guard, typically constructed from reinforced steel bars for safety, which provides a clear view of the forks and load overhead.</p>
<p>Lifted trucks have a negative reputation for being unsafe, but that's simply untrue. This determines how heavy of a load the forklift can handle, and at what different heights.
