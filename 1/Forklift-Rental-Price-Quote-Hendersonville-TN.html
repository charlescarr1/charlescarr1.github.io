<p>For loads exceeding 2500kg, a motorized pallet jack, "walkie stacker" or Forklift is recommended.

OSHA defines a powered industrial truck (PIT) as any mobile, power-propelled truck used to carry, push, pull, lift, stack, or tier materials, whether ridden by the operator or controlled by a walking operator.</p>
