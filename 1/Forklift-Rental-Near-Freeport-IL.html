Well, you're going to have to work a little bit harder than a 6” suspension lift to pimp your truck out, but it's still doable. Theoretically this is to increase off-road performance, although the higher center of gravity would likely make them more likely to roll over on rough terrain.</p>
<p>Also, the Entry Bar Safety Switch at the compartment opening on Crown's stand-up and counterbalance reach trucks slows the truck to a stop and sounds an alarm if operators attempt to drive the truck with part of their foot resting on the ledge.

Before you select any hydraulic pump, however, there are several important pieces of information to take into consideration that will help you match it with the right hydraulic tool, cylinder, or equipment.</p>
<p>Not only this, but a rough terrain forklift is comfortable and easy to service. A parking brake (or mechanism) shall be provided and capable of holding the truck on the maximum grade which the truck can negotiate with rated capacity load, or on a 15 percent grade, whichever is the lesser.
