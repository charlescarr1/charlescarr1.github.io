Also known as a large capacity forklift, the industrial forklift is essential for a warehouse with heavier loads. Class I lift trucks are extremely versatile and can be used in many areas of a production operation from the loading dock to the storage facility.</p>

Our inventory of Lifted and Customized trucks is diverse and ever-changing featuring a wide variety of well-known trucks across many exceptional brands, such as the Ford F-150, Chevrolet Silverado 1500, GMC Sierra 3500HD, Chevy Silverado 2500HD or the Ram 2500.</p>
<p>When it is necessary to omit the overhead guard, special attention should be given by the user and operator to conditions such as height and stability of loads and stacks, weight of individual units, and operating space including overhead obstructions. Whether you use rough terrain forklifts every day or once in awhile, these machines can handle major wear and tear.</p>
