<p>If the operator must frequently enter and exit the forklift to access product, build pallets, etc. Ask what kind of lift it is, who installed it and if there have been any problems with it. Most lifted trucks are bought used so bring along a flash light and inspect the truck for crusted mud in the vehicle's nooks and crannies. Stand-up forklifts (also known as stand-on and electric riders) are designed for applications where the operator must get on and off the lift truck frequently.</p>
<p>Rough terrain forklifts might look like they can only tackle one type of job. These are nice Crown order picker lift trucks with low hours and in good working order. For individuals who do exclusively on-road driving and no hauling, the only noticeable benefit is the lifted line of sight and boosted aesthetic.
